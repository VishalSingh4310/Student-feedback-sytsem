        <div class="pa">One of the primary uses of student feedback is to support the professional development of teaching staff. Regular collection and evaluation of feedback is a vital component of self-reflective practice, aiding teaching staff to identify areas for improvement, as well as providing assurance of improved or continuing teaching quality. Student feedback can be used by staff to reflect on both the efficacy of their individual teaching practice, as well as the curriculum and assessment design of any courses or programs for which they may be responsible. The results of self-evaluation of student feedback can in turn be used to support applications for promotion, tenure and teaching awards, which generally require evidence of sustained high quality teaching practice.</div>
